### Hi there 👋

#### I'm Michael! A software developer that's passionate about designing and developing front-end applications (web and mobile).

👀 Take a look at my [personal website](https://michaelrabbai.com) and it's [repository](https://github.com/michaelrabbai/michaelrabbai.github.io)... it's one of the only repositories you can actually see after all. Stay tuned though, I have a React Native Android and iOS mobile application in the works and other projects/ideas that you'll soon be able to see!

💻 I'm currently looking for fulltime front-end opportunites!

💬 Ask me about my app, project ideas, and what I like to do for fun!

⚡ Fun fact: my friends gave me the nickname "an abundance of serotonin" - I'm a happy guy!
