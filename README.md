### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

#### I'm Michael! A soon-to-be Computer Science graduate (December 2021) that's passionate about designing and developing front-end applications (web and mobile).

Take a look at my personal website... it's the only repository you can actually see after all. Stay tuned though, I have a React Native Android and iOS mobile application in the works and other web application projects/ideas that you'll be able to see soon ðŸ‘€

I'm currently looking for full-time employment starting January 2022.

Ask me about my app and project ideas!

Fun fact: my friends gave me the nickname "an abundance of serotonin" - I'm a happy guy!
